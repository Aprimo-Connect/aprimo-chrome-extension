Sample code for the Aprimo Chrome Extension. 

The Aprimo Chrome Extension allows end users to access their Aprimo tasks via a Chrome Extension.
The Extension has the following features:

•	A system administrator must provide a client ID to use the chrome extension. This prevents users from using a non-approved tool.

•	Users may link the extension to their Aprimo user account.

•	The Assigned and In Process tasks and review tasks assigned to a user are shown.

•	The user may click the task or review task to be taken directly to it in the task inbox.

•	Users can see a badge on the chrome extension which indicates the number of tasks a user currently has that are assigned or in process. This refreshes automatically every 10 minutes.

•	You can use the extension on any page you are visiting – not just Aprimo pages.

While Aprimo publishes a sample version of the Chrome Extension Aprimo does not offer official support of the sample. If the sample has value to users, they are free to use it as-is.

The Aprimo Chrome Extension is open source. Customers and partners may retrieve the source and modify it as needed.
