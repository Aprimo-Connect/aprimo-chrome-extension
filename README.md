This code is provided by Aprimo _as-is_ as an example of how you might solve a specific business problem. It is not intended for direct use in Production without modification.

You are welcome to submit issues or feedback to help us improve visibility into potential bugs or enhancements. Aprimo may, at its discretion, address minor bugs, but does not guarantee fixes or ongoing support.

It is expected that developers who clone or use this code take full responsibility for supporting, maintaining, and securing any deployments derived from it.

If you are interested in a production-ready and supported version of this solution, please contact your Aprimo account representative. They can connect you with our technical services team or a partner who may be able to build and support a packaged implementation for you.

# aprimo-chrome-extension
Sample code for the Aprimo Chrome Extension. 

The Aprimo Chrome Extension allows end users to access their Aprimo tasks via a Chrome Extension.
The Extension has the following features:

•	A system administrator must provide a client ID to use the chrome extension. This prevents users from using a non-approved tool.

•	Users may link the extension to their Aprimo user account.

•	The Assigned and In Process tasks and review tasks assigned to a user are shown.

•	The user may click the task or review task to be taken directly to it in the task inbox.

•	Users can see a badge on the chrome extension which indicates the number of tasks a user currently has that are assigned or in process. This refreshes automatically every 10 minutes.

•	You can use the extension on any page you are visiting – not just Aprimo pages.

While Aprimo publishes a sample version of the Chrome Extension Aprimo does not offer official support of the sample. If the sample has value to users, they are free to use it as-is.

The Aprimo Chrome Extension is open source. Customers and partners may retrieve the source and modify it as needed.
